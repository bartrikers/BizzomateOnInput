# BizzomateOnInput
 
This widget creates an input textbox which can trigger an onChange microflow while the user is still typing. It's done by connecting
to the onInput event and you can configure a delay so the micorflow is only triggered when the user is done typing.

## Typical usage scenario

Can be used to create a custom search function for example.

## Features and limitations
* Allows an action to be triggered while the user is still editing the input field
* Can be used with Microflow or Nanoflow on change


## Dependencies
* Build and tested using Mendix 7.23.10
